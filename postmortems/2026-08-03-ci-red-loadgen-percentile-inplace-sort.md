## Narrative

## Summary
`CI pipeline red on main` fired (sev1) after CI run #110 on `main` failed its `test` job. The pipeline never reached `build-push`/deploy for this revision, so no bad artifact shipped — but `main` is unshippable until fixed.

## Impact
- `main` branch CI is red; any subsequent merge/build relies on a broken base.
- No production deploy occurred from the bad commit (`build-push` job was `skipped`, confirmed via `deploy_history` — the last actual deploys were the `platform`/`gateway` gitops syncs finishing at 23:32:21Z, all before this commit landed).
- Blast radius is CI/dev-velocity only, not runtime/serving.

## Root cause
Commit `28686bc2ba` — "load-generator: drop the defensive copy in percentile()" — is the only source change since the last known-good run (#109, sha `283cec4c08`; verified via `gitea_compare` with the 7 intervening commits all being postmortem-doc-only additions). The diff:

```diff
- const sorted = [...values].sort((a, b) => a - b);
+ // Sort in place: percentile() runs three times per summary and the defensive
+ // copy showed up in the run loop's profile.
+ const sorted = (values as number[]).sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

`percentile()` is called three times per summary against the same shared `values` array. Removing the defensive copy and sorting in place mutates the caller's original array as a side effect of the first call, which the `test` job's assertions caught. Cross-checked against the prior 7 CI runs on `main` (#94 through #109) — the `test` job passed on every one of them, so this is a genuine regression introduced by this commit, not a flaky job or infra issue.

## What fixed it
Nothing yet — this incident's toolset (per the matched `ci-pipeline-red` runbook) is diagnosis-and-escalation only; fixing a broken test/build requires editing `apps/load-generator/src/stats.ts`, which is out of scope for the on-call agent's fixed remediation surface. **Recommended fix: revert commit `28686bc2ba` on `main`** (fastest safe path back to shippable) — restore the defensive copy in `percentile()`, or if the perf win is wanted, copy once per summary instead of once per call rather than mutating the caller's array. Handing this to the auto-fixer/PR flow as a follow-up.

## Lessons
- `percentile()`'s contract (pure, non-mutating) was implicit; the in-place-sort optimization violated it silently until CI caught it — worth a comment/type (`ReadonlyArray` typing didn't stop the `as number[]` cast) or an explicit test asserting non-mutation to prevent recurrence.
- Alert correctly fired sev1 even though nothing deployed — confirms the build/test-red vs deploy-red distinction in the runbook worked as intended (this was the lower-severity case, no rollout impact).
